# ✅ DEPRECATION WARNING FIXED - FastAPI Lifespan Events

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Issue**: 
```
DeprecationWarning: on_event is deprecated, use lifespan event handlers instead.
```

### **Solution**: Replaced deprecated `@app.on_event("shutdown")` with modern `lifespan` context manager

---

## 📝 Changes Made to `server.py`

### **1. Added Import** (Line 6):
```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
```

### **2. Created Lifespan Context Manager** (Before app creation):
```python
# Lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown events
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup: MongoDB is already connected
    logger.info("🚀 Application startup - MongoDB connected")
    yield
    # Shutdown: Close MongoDB connection
    client.close()
    logger.info("👋 Application shutdown - MongoDB disconnected")
```

### **3. Updated FastAPI App Creation**:
```python
# OLD (Deprecated):
app = FastAPI()

# NEW (Modern):
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

### **4. Removed Deprecated Event Handler** (Line 661):
```python
# REMOVED:
@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_db_client():
    client.close()
```

## ✅ Result

**Server now starts with:**
- ✅ No deprecation warnings
- ✅ Proper startup/shutdown lifecycle management
- ✅ MongoDB connection cleanup on shutdown
- ✅ Compatible with FastAPI best practices (2024+)

## 🚀 How to Start the Server

```powershell
# Navigate to backend folder
cd C:\Users\akshi\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\Cryptodata\CryptoData\backend

# Start server
python server.py
```

**You should see:**
```
🚀 Application startup - MongoDB connected
INFO:     Started server process [XXXX]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**No more deprecation warnings!** ✅

## 📚 FastAPI Lifespan Events Documentation

The `lifespan` context manager handles both startup and shutdown:
- **Before `yield`**: Startup code (runs once when server starts)
- **After `yield`**: Shutdown code (runs once when server stops)

This is the modern, recommended way to handle application lifecycle in FastAPI.
