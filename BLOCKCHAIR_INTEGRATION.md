    }
  },
  "erc20_tokens": [
    {
      "token_name": "Tether USD",
      "token_symbol": "USDT",

### 4. **ERC-20 Token Analysis**

For Ethereum addresses, get complete token portfolio:
- All ERC-20 token holdings
- Token names, symbols, decimals
- Current balances
- Approximate USD values

### 5. **Full-Text Search**

Search for any address, transaction hash, or identifier across all 41 blockchains!

    "address": "bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh",
    "crypto_type": "bitcoin",
    "notes": "Suspected WannaCry ransomware payment address - investigate transaction patterns"
  }'

# Then analyze it
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/addresses/analyze \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "bc1qxy2kgdygjrsqtzq2n0yrf2493p83kkfjhx0wlh",
