## ‚ùì Why You Can't See Data

### **Possible Reasons:**

1. **No Scraping Done Yet**
   - Solution: Go to Seed Manager ‚Üí Click Play button on any seed
   
2. **Database Empty (Fresh Install)**
   - Solution: MongoDB was just started, no historical data exists
   - Fix: Run manual scrapes to populate database
   
3. **Redis Not Running (Autonomous Mode Disabled)**
   - Current Status: Demo mode - scraping returns simulated 0-15 addresses
   - Solution: For real data, install Redis (optional)
   - Impact: Manual scraping still works, just returns simulated counts
   
4. **Backend Not Connected**
   - Check: Backend logs show "MongoDB connected"
   - Fix: Ensure backend is running on port 8000

5. **Frontend Cache Issue**
   - Solution: Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5

## üîß Current System Status

### ‚úÖ **Working:**
- ‚úÖ Login/Authentication
- ‚úÖ Dashboard display
- ‚úÖ MongoDB connected
- ‚úÖ Theme toggle (Dark/Light)
- ‚úÖ All menu navigation
- ‚úÖ Manual address registration
- ‚úÖ Seed Manager interface
- ‚úÖ Demo mode scraping (simulated results)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Demo Mode (No Real Data Yet):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Scraping returns random 0-15 addresses (simulated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No real network requests to target websites
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Statistics show 0 because database is empty
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to run actual scrapes or manually add addresses

### üöÄ **To Get Real Data:**

**Option 1: Manual Address Entry (Immediate)**
1. Go to "Register Address"
2. Add 5-10 test addresses manually
3. Check "Address Registry" to see them
4. Dashboard will update with statistics

**Option 2: Install Redis for Real Scraping**
1. Redis already running in Docker ‚úÖ
2. Need to start Celery workers:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   celery -A celery_app worker --loglevel=info --pool=solo
   ```
3. Scraping will fetch real addresses from websites
4. Database will populate automatically

**Option 3: Test with Sample Data**
- I can create a script to populate sample addresses for testing
