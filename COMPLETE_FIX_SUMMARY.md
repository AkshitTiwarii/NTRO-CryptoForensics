## ⚙️ Current System Status

### ✅ **Fully Working:**
- ✅ Login/Authentication (admin/admin123)
- ✅ MongoDB connected and storing data
- ✅ Theme toggle (Dark ↔ Light mode)
- ✅ All menu navigation working
- ✅ Manual address registration
- ✅ Seed Manager interface
- ✅ Demo mode scraping (simulated 0-15 addresses per scrape)
- ✅ Address Registry displaying data
- ✅ "Made with Emergent" logo removed
- ✅ All tracking scripts removed

### ⚠️ **Demo Mode (Simulated Data):**
- Current: Scraping returns random 0-15 addresses (simulated)
- Why: Redis not connected to backend (but MongoDB running)
- Impact: System works perfectly for demo, just with simulated scrape counts
- Upgrade: Install Redis for real web scraping

---

## 💡 Why You Couldn't See Data Before

### **Reasons:**

1. **Looking in Wrong Place**
   - ❌ Dashboard shows stats (counts), not actual addresses
   - ✅ Address Registry shows actual data

2. **Database Was Empty**
   - Fresh MongoDB installation had no historical data
   - Needed to run scrapes first

3. **Didn't Trigger Scraping Yet**
   - Seed Manager has Play buttons (▶) to trigger scrapes
   - Must manually click Play to start scraping

4. **Demo Mode Active**
   - System returns simulated address counts (0-15)
   - Real scraping requires Redis (optional)
