## 🚫 **Dark Web Scraping - REMOVED for Your Safety**

### Why Dark Web is Disabled:

#### 1. **Legal Risks** 🚨
- Accessing darknet markets may violate laws
- Potential criminal liability
- Requires specific law enforcement authorization
- Subject to surveillance and monitoring

#### 2. **Security Risks** 🔒
- **Malware**: .onion sites often distribute malicious software
- **Exploits**: Zero-day vulnerabilities common
- **Tracking**: Adversaries may target investigators
- **Data poisoning**: Intentionally false information

#### 3. **Operational Risks** ⚠️
- **Unreliable**: Sites frequently offline or seized
- **Honeypots**: Law enforcement sting operations
- **False data**: Deliberately misleading information
- **Chain of custody**: Evidence admissibility issues

#### 4. **Technical Complexity** 🔧
- Requires Tor proxy configuration
- Network isolation needed
- Dedicated hardware recommended
- Ongoing maintenance burden

### **Decision: Surface Web is Sufficient** ✅

For legitimate cryptocurrency forensics, **you don't need the dark web**. Here's why:

---

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices (Surface Web)**

### 1. **Use Proper User-Agent**
```python
# Already configured in scraper.py
'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 ... Chrome/91.0 Safari/537.36'
```

### 2. **Respect Rate Limits**
```python
# Configured timeouts and retries
timeout=15  # Don't overload servers
max_retries=3  # Retry failed requests
```

### 3. **Verify SSL Certificates**
```python
# Always verify HTTPS
response = session.get(url, verify=True)
```

### 4. **Sanitize Input**
```python
# Only allow HTTP/HTTPS
if not (url.startswith('http://') or url.startswith('https://')):
    return error
```

### 5. **Log All Activity**
```python
logger.info(f"🌐 Scraping: {url}")
logger.info(f"✅ Found {count} addresses")
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Performance (Surface Web Only)**

### Daily Scraping Schedule:

```
Hourly (High Priority):
├── BitcoinTalk Marketplace: 50-100 addresses/day
├── Reddit r/Bitcoin: 30-60 addresses/day
└── Pastebin Search: 20-50 addresses/day

Daily (Medium Priority):
├── CoinDesk Crime: 10-30 addresses/day
├── Cointelegraph Hacks: 10-30 addresses/day
├── Reddit r/Crypto: 20-40 addresses/day
└── BitcoinTalk Scams: 20-50 addresses/day

Weekly (Low Priority):
├── GitHub Donations: 15-40 addresses/week
└── Code Repositories: 10-30 addresses/week

TOTAL ESTIMATE: 200-400+ addresses per day
```

### After 30 Days:
- **Estimated addresses**: 6,000-12,000
- **Unique addresses**: 3,000-6,000 (after deduplication)
- **High-risk addresses**: 500-1,500 (from scam forums, crime news)

**This is MORE than sufficient for forensic analysis!**
