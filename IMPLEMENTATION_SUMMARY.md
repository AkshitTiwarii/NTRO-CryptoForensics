## üéì Lessons Learned

### **What Worked Well**

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules (`crypto_collector`, `ml_categorizer`, `blockchair_api`) made development fast and testing easy

2. **API-First Design**: FastAPI with OpenAPI docs meant frontend could develop in parallel

3. **Professional Tools**: Using Blockchair instead of basic blockchain explorers elevated the solution to enterprise-grade

4. **Comprehensive Docs**: Documentation-first approach made onboarding and presentation prep easy

### **What Could Be Improved**

1. **Database**: In-memory storage is fine for demo but needs PostgreSQL for production (schema already designed)

2. **Deep Web**: Tor integration should have been prioritized earlier (still achievable in 6 hours)

3. **ML Models**: Trained models would be more impressive than rule-based categorization (requires labeled dataset)

4. **Testing**: More unit tests and integration tests would increase confidence
